<!-- <article style="font-weight: bold;">Ha Mim Sajdah 41:53] We will soon show them Our signs in the Horizons and in their own souls, until it will become quite clear to them that it/He is the truth/Real. Is it not sufficient as regards your Lord that He is a witness over all things?</article>
<br>
<article>
  Allah (swt) refers to all things as his signs (ayah). This divine practice in itself is indicative of a profound truth that Allah (swt) not only speaks to us through the Quran, but also through his creation. The book, the universe and us, we are all Allah’s creations and we are all His signs. Through us He speaks; He reveals the Reality and the Truth that He is and what His attributes are. So Allah can be reached and known not only through the comprehension of His book, but also through the study of our universe and through the contemplation upon ourselves. Religion, science and contemplation are all Ibadah and all will lead us to Him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sign – 41:53—suggests that Truth can be found within us and in the creation at large.  We can either turn inwards or open outwards and we will find Him. Some commentators have interpreted this ayah as speaking of how the Truth of the Quran/Islam will manifest itself across the universe. And how eventually within us we will realize the Truth that is revealed to us. But others have pointed that this ayah suggests that all things in the universe, including the most fundamental sensations within our soul, point to the sole Reality of Allah, as evidenced from the fact that all things emanate from Him, since he is witness to them all.
  <br>
  <br>
  This ayah also reveals the unity between the individual self and the universe. It is in their function as manifests of Allah’s reality and the truth of Islam that the human soul and the universe become one. In this they together also manifest the principle of Tawhid (Divine Unity).
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the two understandings are compatible since in Allah, Truth and Reality become one.  So let us reflect upon the signs of Allah, inside and outside, in matter and in mind, so that we may understand, so that we may know.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wallahu Alam.
